# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize would like to know about how the data summarized by the ride-sharing data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

1. Create a DataFrame summary of the ride-sharing data by city type.
2. Plot a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
The analysis of the DataFrame summary show that:
- For rural and suburban types of cities there are less drivers than there are rides compared to urban cities.
- Based on the Ride-Share Summary, one can see that when comparing the average fare per ride and average fare per driver, there is a higher gain for the average fare per driver for the rural and suburban city types.

- Based on the chart it can be gleaned that the urban city type has a higher average fare than the suburban and rural city types.

## Challenge Overview
This analysis was challenging in that it forced me to look up many things such as using the pivot() and resample() functions. These two were interesting in that it helped to make a pivot table within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Challenge Summary
It is suggested that there be a limit to the number of drivers for the urban city type or that there be a greater emphasis on promoting the business so the number of riders increases. It is also suggested that the rural city type increase their fare prices.
